# pcl_utils

This program modifies pcl_utils b y wyatt.newman@case.edu and adapts from cluster_extraction from the pcl library. When run, it takes in a specific point cloud image (coke_can.pcd) and identifies various locations and referance frames relative to a can and the stool which it sits on.

## Usage

Go into the directory where 'coke_can.pcd' is stored.
'rosrun pcl_utils find_plane_pcd_file'
